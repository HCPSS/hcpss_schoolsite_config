# HCPSS School Site Configuration

This is a simple Drupal module to house some configuration setting that are used
throughout HCPSS School Sites.

It adds "School Code" and "Facebook URL" settings to the site information form 
for example https://example.com/admin/config/system/site-information. School code 
is set to an initial value that it guesses from the database name, but it can be 
changed on the form.
